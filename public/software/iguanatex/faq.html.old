<h2><a name="errormessages"></a>Error messages</h2>
<p class="ques">Q: When pressing the Create button in
IguanaTex, I get the error message: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Could not start
process: 'latex -interaction=batchmode "addin_tmp.tex"'. GetLastError
returned 0.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 500px; height: 107px;"
 alt="Could not start process: 'latex interaction=batchmode &quot;addin_tmp.tex&quot;'. GetLastError return 0."
 src="start_process.png"><br>
</div>
<p>A: This problem occurs when IguanaTex is unable to locate MikTex in
order to compile your Latex file. To verify that this is indeed the
problem, click on Start, then on Run, then type <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">cmd</span> and press Enter. In the new
window type <span style="font-family: monospace;">latex</span> and
press Enter. You should see the Latex command prompt. If instead you
receive an error message such as <span style="font-style: italic;">'latex'
is not recognized as an internal or external command</span>, then there
is a problem with your installation of MikTex. Verify that you have
MikTex installed and that the version you are using is still supported
by the MikTex team (version 2.6 at the earliest). Reinstalling the
latest version of <a href="http://miktex.org/" target="_blank">MikTex</a> should solve
this problem.</p>

<p class="ques">Q: When pressing the Create button in
IguanaTex, I get the error message: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Run-time error
'-2147024809 (80070057)': The specified file wasn't found.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 371px; height: 208px;"
 alt="Run-time error '-2147024809 (80070057)': The specified file wasn't found."
 src="file_not_found.png"><br>
</div>
<p>A: This problem is usually caused when the program dvipng, or other MikTex components, are not
installed correctly. dvipng is usually installed with MikTex, but
some 'minimal' or 'custom' MikTex installation options do
not include it. To verify that this is the problem, generate the above error message and then
check the contents of the temporary directory which you specified when installing IguanaTex.
If dvipng or some of its component packages are missing, you will see a tex file containing
your LaTeX code, and a dvi file, but no png file.</p>
<p>There are three ways to solve this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some users have been able to install the missing packages by clicking on the Debug
checkbox in the IguanaTex window. This then allowed MikTex to pop-up the install window
and install any missing software.</li>
<li>If this does not work, switch to the temporary directory you chose when installing
IguanaTex (usually <span style="font-family:monospace;">c:\temp</span>).
The directory should contain the file addin_tmp.dvi.
Then, run the command:<br/>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">dvipng&nbsp;addin_tmp.dvi</span><br/>
You should now see dvipng installing whatever missing packages were required during
the creation of the IguanaTex image. After doing this successfully, you should be
able to use IguanaTex with no problems.</li>
<li>If all else fails, reinstall MikTex and choose the "Complete" setting
during installation; this will install dvipng and the packages it requires, but
will take some time.</li>
</ol>

<p class="ques">Q: When pressing the Create button in
IguanaTex, I get a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Path not found</span> error message. (Occurs on Windows 7)</p>
<p>A: Windows 7 has enhanced security measures which limit the ability of
programs to write to some directories on the hard disk. When installing
IguanaTex, you were asked to specify a directory for IguanaTex's
temporary files. Make sure that this directory exists, and that you are
allowed to write to it (for example, by creating a text file in this
directory). If the directory does not exist, you can simply create it.
If the directory exists but you cannot create text files there, or if
you receive a confirmation message from Windows when you attempt to
create a text file in that directory, you will have to re-install
IguanaTex and specify a different temp directory. A directory such as
C:\Temp is usually appropriate.</p>

<p class="ques">Q: When trying to run IguanaTex, I get a 
<span style="font-style: italic">Run-time error '70': Permission denied</span>
error message.</p>
<p>A: For IguanaTex to function, PowerPoint security settings must be
set such that macros are allowed to run. To verify that your security settings
are correct:</p>
<ul><li>In PowerPoint 2007 and 2010: 
click the Office button, select PowerPoint Options,
click Trust Center, then Trust Center Settings, and then choose Macro Settings.
Select Medium Security Level (or lower) and click OK.</li>
<li>In PowerPoint 2002 and 2003: from the Tools menu, choose Options.
Click on the Security tab, then click Macro Security. In the Security Level
tab, select Medium Security Level (or lower) and click OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this error occurs in Windows 7, it may also be a result of your operating system's security measures.

<h2><a name="bugs"></a>Other bugs</h2>
<p class="ques">Q: Some parts of the equation
(especially subscripts or superscripts) do not appear. For example, I
get the following equation:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 307px; height: 98px;"
 alt="You may encounter missing subscript symbols the first time you run IguanaTex."
 src="subscript_bug_1.png"><br>
</div>
<p class="ques">but I would like to see the following:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 309px; height: 105px;"
 alt="Running IguanaTex again on the same equation will work around this bug, which typically appears only once per computer."
 src="subscript_bug_2.png"><br>
</div>
<p>A: This is a known issue in IguanaTex. It occurs only once per
computer. As a workaround, re-open the resulting equation in IguanaTex,
and click on Modify; the equation will then be displayed correctly. You
will probably never see this problem again. This bug will be fixed in a
future version of IguanaTex.</p>

<p class="ques">Q: Why can't I double-click on an
equation to edit it? (In PowerPoint 2007)</p>
A: Unfortunately, for reasons which are not clear to me, Microsoft
disabled this feature in PowerPoint 2007. The feature works fine in
PowerPoint 2003. This is apparently a bug in PowerPoint. See <a
 href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/32731534/powerpoint-2003-addins-do.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>
for some technical information about this bug. As a workaround, click
on the equation and then choose "Edit Latex Equation" from the Add-ins
tab. Much less convenient, I know. Blame Microsoft.</p>

<p class="ques">Q: While editing an equation, pressing Enter causes the Create button
to be pressed, rather than moving down a line.</p>
<p>A: This issue was fixed in version 1.04 of IguanaTex. Please <a
 href="http://www.technion.ac.il/%7Ezvikabh/software/iguanatex/">download
and install the latest version</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="howto"/>How Do I...</h2>

<p class="ques">Q: How do I make equations in colors other than black?</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 alt="An example of an IguanaTex equation with color."
 src="coloreqn.gif">
</div>
<p>A: Use the LaTeX 
<a href="http://people.oregonstate.edu/~peterseb/tex/samples/color-package.html" target="_blank">color
package</a>.</p>

<p class="ques">Q: How do I include my favorite LaTeX macros, command definitions, 
and custom definitions?</p>
<p>A: The simplest method is to include your definitions as the default IguanaTex 
LaTeX code. Just type or paste whatever definitions you want into the IguanaTex LaTeX
text box and then click "Make Default". From now on, all new IguanaTex equations will 
include these definitions.</p>
<p>A slightly more generic solution is to add an \include command to your default 
IguanaTex LaTeX code. The \include command will reference a file containing all your
macros and definitions. In this way, you can add new commands and edit existing ones
more easily.</p>

<p class="ques">Q: Can I use keyboard shortcuts to add or edit equations?</p>
<p>A: This requires a bit of work since this capability is not natively
supported in PowerPoint. Here's a procedure which worked for Ahiteme:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the <a href="http://officeone.mvps.org/ppsctmgr/ppsctmgr.html">OfficeOne Shortcut Manager</a>. This is try-before-you-buy software. (I am not affiliated with OfficeOne in any way; please don't ask me questions about their product.)</li>
<li>Create a new presentation by opening the file IguanaTex.ppt and saving it under a new name.</li>
<li>Use the Shortcut Manager to create shortcuts for the macros NewLatexEquation and/or EditLatexEquations.</li>
</ol>

<p class="ques">Q: Can I make my own changes to the IguanaTex source code?</p>
<p>A: Certainly! The IguanaTex source code is freely available for your use.
When installing IguanaTex, make sure to check the "Install IguanaTex source code"
check box. You will then have a PPT file placed in the same directory as the PPA
file. This PPT file contains the Visual Basic for PowerPoint source code for
IguanaTex.</p>

<h2><a name="os"/>System Requirements</h2>

<p class="ques">Q: Can IguanaTex run on 64-bit Windows systems?</p>
<p>A: Yes, a 64-bit version of IguanaTex is available. Choose "IguanaTex 64-bit" 
in the <a href="download.html">download page</a>. (Many thanks to Amir Bin Sulaiman
for preparing the 64-bit version!)</p>

<p class="ques">Q: Can you use IguanaTex on a Mac?</p>
<p>A: No. For a similar product allowing you to embed LaTeX code into Keynote, try 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/math_science/latexit.html" target="_blank">LatexIt</a>.</p>

<p class="ques">Q: Does IguanaTex work with Microsoft Word?</p>
<p>A: No. IguanaTex does not currently work with Word. Sorry about that!</p>
