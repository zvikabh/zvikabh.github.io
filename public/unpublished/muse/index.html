<h2><i>Muse</i>: Musical Database Search using Audio Query</h2>
<p><font size="-1"><a target="_top" href="/">Back</a> to my home page</font></p>
<p><i>Muse</i> is a computer program for automatic song identification using an
audio query. The user hums a few notes from a song; these are analyzed and
searched for in a database. <i>Muse</i> was written as my graduation project
during my BSc studies at the Technion, under the supervision of Gal Ashour of
IBM.</p>
<p>All of the material relating to the <i>Muse</i> project is available for free
download from this site, including the program source code. You are welcome to
use this material as you see fit, but please give credit where due. If you do
something neat with <i>Muse</i>, please let me know.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of screen shots from the program...</p>

<p align="left">To use <i>Muse</i>, you need to download the executable (for use
in Windows 95 and higher) and a song database. Naturally <i>Muse</i> will be
able to identify only songs in the database you are using. The sample database
we provide here contains some 230 songs, including many Beatles classics and
some Hebrew songs. You can also construct your own database; let me know if you
have a larger database that you'd like to put up in this site. Please note that
identification is most efficient when you sing the notes as &quot;ta-ta-ta&quot;
or &quot;ti-ti-ti&quot;. You are not supposed to sing the words of the song; it
is assumed that if the words are known, you do not need the program!</p>

works, you can download the entire source code. The program is based on MFC and
is intended to be compiled under Visual C++ 5.</p>
