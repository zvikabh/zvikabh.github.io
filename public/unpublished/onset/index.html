      Before you go on reading, please listen carefully to the following two 2-second
      piano recordings, and see if you can put your finger on the difference between
      the recordings.

      Most people will hear a difference between the two, perhaps thinking that they were
      recorded on different instruments, or that the notes are different.

      The two audio clips above are actually piano recordings from which the first 200
      msec have been removed. Here are the original recordings, with those 200 msec
      included. Can you now tell what the difference between the recordings is?

      The first recording is a piano playing a Middle C. The second recording is the
      same piano playing a Middle C together with a High C (one octave above). Because
      the base frequnecy and the harmonics of the High C all fall on harmonics of the
      Middle C, it is not trivial to hear the High C.

      This experiment demonstrates the importance of the note onset (the first few hundred
      milliseconds) in humans&rsquo; ability to differentiate between notes. The onset
      contains nonlinear effects which fade out over time, and these turn out to be
      important in differentiating notes in a chord.

      This is based on a similar experiment which I saw described in a musical acoustics
      textbook long ago. Sadly I was unable to find this reference. If anyone is aware
      of a published source describing this phenomenon, please let me know and I will
      add a citation here.
